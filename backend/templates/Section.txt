### Review Guidelines
    - Critique Requirements:
       1. Analyze the manuscript based on its natural structure and organization. Identify its main sections as defined by the author (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Results, etc.).
       2. For each section, critique its content, structure, and presentation based on the following principles:
            Clarity and coherence of writing.
            Logical flow and relevance to the research objectives.
            Adequacy of information provided (e.g., context, methods, results).
            Strength of argumentation and justification.
        3.Provide precise, actionable recommendations to address the identified weaknesses.
        4.Reference specific sentences or phrases from the manuscript to substantiate critiques and contextualize recommendations. 

### Evaluation Process
    Step 1: Identify Sections Based on Manuscript Structure
        Carefully review the manuscript to identify its structural components as defined by the author (e.g., Abstract, Literature Review, Experiments).
        Note that if there is any inconsistency with the Section-Specific Guidelines structure, the author's structure should be used for chapter analysis.    
    Step 2: Critique Each Section
        For each section identified in the manuscript:
        Evaluate its quality and effectiveness.
        Identify specific limitations or weaknesses.
        Based on the deficiencies raised in the analysis article, corresponding feasible improvement suggestions are put forward.
